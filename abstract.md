We are today observing two rapid shifts in the field of social robotics and
human-robot interaction: going from focused lab studies to complex real-world
experiments; relying more and more on data-driven techniques to both interpret and generate
socially congruent behaviours.

In this seminar, I will present the work accomplished at BRL over the last 3
years to push forward this agenda, and sketch out some of the coming challenges.
